    <p> Hi! My name is MOHAMMAD YOUSEF, I’m 37 years old, I was born in Amman which is the capital of Jordan . where I lived for
     eleven years, but sixteen years ago, my dad decided to change his job, and we all moved to NEW YORK. I have a 2 sisterS and
     2 brothers . My dad is a fashion designer. My mom used to teach at the school and now she works as a nurse.
     

 
    </body><h2> </h2>I’m interested in computer science, music, sport and app development. Computers first appered in my life when I was 18.
    Then I had got my first computer. It was Commodore 64 and I remember myself thinking, that it was the best thing in the world.
    I was playing it whenever I could. Then I had got my first PC. At first, I was just playing computer games, but some time later,
    I noticed that I could do a lot more things with the computer, for example programming, building websites , and a lot more with
    CSS and HTML. I have my own site on the internet, My next project to learn more programming langueges to build my own video game .
    I hope that in the future I will be one of the best developers </h1>
